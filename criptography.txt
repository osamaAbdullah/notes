private/symetric key encription:
- both side should have one shared scret key
- faster than public key
- can only be used for confidentiality (deliver messege securely)
- ESA 

public/asymetric key encription:
- both side will have a key pair (private, public)
- slower than private key 
- can be used for confidentiality and digitail signture (make sure that one that sent that message was the one who owns the private key)
- RSA, DSA, elliptic curve

Hashing Algurithms 
- one-way digest
- unique
- collision resistance (if two different inputs are hashed it should generate two different outputs)
_               week    week     good              good
- fixed length (MD5 32, SHA1 40, SHA2 (SHA256) 62, SHA3 (SHA384))
